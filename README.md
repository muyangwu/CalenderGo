# CSE110
CalendarGo is an event aggregator designed for mobile Android devices that allows students to find activities on campus. Events may be created by anyone who wishes to advertise their event, and each event is sorted by category by default. The map view will display all events that are taking place today, while the calendar view allows users to view the events that will take place on an given day.
